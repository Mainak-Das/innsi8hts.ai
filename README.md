# innsi8hts.ai - Hotel Reviews Sentiment Analyser

Welcome to this **Hotel Sentiment Analysis** project! This repository contains all the necessary components to scrape, analyze, predict & summarise sentiments from hotel reviews.

## üöÄ Project Overview

**innsi8hts.ai** project is designed to analyze hotel reviews and predict sentiments, categorizing them as positive or negative. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques combined with classical Machine Learning models, the system automates sentiment analysis, allowing hotels to gain valuable insights into guest feedback. This solution helps in understanding customer satisfaction, identifying areas for improvement, and enhancing overall service quality. Additionally, the platform simplifies the process by providing detailed insights into the reviews, making it easier for hotel management to act on customer opinions effectively.
